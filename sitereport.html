            <h2>My Development Journey</h2>
            <p>This website was created as part of my web development assignment, The experience has been challenging
                but rewarding. I had ups and down when creating it but I managed to get through and learn alot while
                doing so. I focused on building a responsive, simplistic design that reflects my passion for gaming and
                coding.</p>
            <p>I went through multiple videos and lectures on aiming to completely master web devlopment and I can now
                confidently say I can build a good responsive website from scratch. I also took inspiration on the first
                page from a video I saw on youtube by procoder, I really like how he had a typing-text which explained
                who he is in one line. For my debugging process, I had encountered many issues with my code, I was
                seeing errors I had never seen before. I had used W3Schools as a guideline to help with any error codes
                I got when checking my work. That website helped me with alot of problems and questions I had for
                myself.

            <h3>
                The key moments I went through in order to build what I built today
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding HTML structure and semantic tags.</li>
                <li>Using CSS to create a responsive design.</li>
                <li>Incorporating images, videos, and interactive elements.</li>
                <li>Debugging and validating my code</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Design Choices</h3>
            <p> For the design process I felt as If the world as we know it today is becoming more minimalistic and has
                a modern look which is what I went for. I went on coolors.co and picked a trending color palette which
                was loved by a lot and came out with the colors, Hit Gray, Ghost,and Pale Sky. I chose a dark theme to
                align with my gaming interests, using bold fonts and bright highlights to make content stand out. I was
                inspired by modern gaming UI designs.</p>
