                    <h3>Project 1</h3>
                    <p>A Gaming tournament that I won recently, I had went to a gaming hub with my friends in hopes to win the prizes they were offering. It was a gaming chair, money used at their establishment and other free items. My team and I won all of our games without dropping a game. This a group photo we took together.</p>

                    <h3>Project 2</h3>
                    <p>Here is a coding challenge I had faced when doing my AS1 for Problem Solving and Programming, It had taken me a while to figure out how to complete it but when I did, I tested it and It was working perfectly.</p>
