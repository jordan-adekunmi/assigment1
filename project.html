                    <h3>Project 1</h3>
                    <p>A Gaming tournament that I won recently, I had went to a gaming hub with my friends in hopes to
                        win the prizes they were offering. It was a gaming chair, money used at their establishment and
                        other free items. My team and I won all of our games without dropping a game. This a group photo
                        we took together.</p>

                    <h3>Project 2</h3>
                    <p>Here is a coding challenge I had faced when doing my AS1 for Problem Solving and Programming, It
                        had taken me a while to figure out how to complete it but when I did, I tested it and It was
                        working perfectly.</p>

                    <h3>Project 3</h3>
                    <p>Here is a picture of a culture fundraiser that my team and I hosted in Sixth form. We were
                        raising money for a charity which specialised in raising awareness for the countries which were
                        less fortunate. We all made food showcasing the food of the country where we were from.</p>
